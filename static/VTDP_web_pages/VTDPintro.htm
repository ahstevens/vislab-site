  <p>We all  think visually, some of the time. For the most part we are unaware that we are visual thinking, as in the case  that we thread our way through a crowded room, or when we arrange groups of  chopped vegetables and other ingredients on a countertop in preparing to  cook a complicated dish.  Graphic  designers may think consciously of design decisions, analyzing which  combination of colors and forms most clearly conveys the required information,  but they are in the minority.</p>
  <p>We also use visualizations as thinking tools. Many people  who work creatively, construct rough and ready sketches, which are often   unintelligible to anyone else, that somehow help them organize their thoughts.  Those abstract squiggles hint at different ways of partitioning physical  space or the space of ideas or even both together.</p>
  <p>Visualizations are tools for reasoning  about data and to be effective they must support the activities of visual  thinking.  Part of this is ensuring that  data is mapped to the display in such a way that informative patterns are  available to resolve visual queries concerning the cognitive task. This  requires matching the graphic representation with the capabilities of human  visualization.  For example, correlations  between variables should be visually easy to see and commonly searched for  symbols should be more distinctive than those that are rarely sought out.  In addition, interactions must be designed to  support an efficient visual thinking process. Visual analytics is an example of  distributed cognition and cognitively efficient interactions require that  perceptual and cognitive processes in the brain of the analyst must be  efficiently linked to computational processes in a computer. For example, data  points representing companies can be shown simultaneously in a map view and in  a scatter plot view; the technique of brushing can be applied so that points on  the map, when selected, are highlighted in both views. This can support reasoning  about the growth of industries related to geographic regions, but to be  cognitively efficient the brushing effect should ideally appear in less than a  tenth of a second. </p>
  <p>Visual Thinking Design Patterns (VTDPs) are based partly on a prior construct developed by Ware [1] and called  visual thinking algorithms (VTAs).  VTDPs  represent a broadening of this original concept with a change in emphasis.  VTDPs are a method for describing the combined human-machine cognitive  processes that are executed when interactive data visualizations are used as  cognitive tools.</p>
  <p>VTDPs take their  inspiration from Alexander’s design patterns [2] intended for architects and from design patterns  developed for software engineering [3].  Although considerable research has shown that  perceptual and cognitive principles can be applied usefully to the design of  interactive visualization, this knowledge is only applied in practice if a  particular designer has taken an interest in the relevant research.  VTDPs are intended to provide an accessible  structured method for combining knowledge about interaction methods and  visualization designs together with cognitive and perceptual principles.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Like their precedents, VTDPs are intended to  describe best practice example solutions to design problems where interactive  visualization is an intended component.  </li>
    <li>VTDPs provide a method for taking into account  perceptual and cognitive issues especially key bottlenecks in the visual  thinking process, such as limited visual working memory capacity.  They also provide a way of reasoning about  semiotic issues in perceptual terms via the concept of the visual query. </li>
    <li>VTDPs incorporate the common set of interactive  techniques used in visualization and suggest how they may be used separately or  in combination.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>VTDPs should be  understandable with a modest amount of training, and it should be possible to  incorporate them into common design practices. VTDPs are potentially applicable  to all visualization design problems, including design of presentation  materials, interactive training materials and  analytic  tools.  The following section   concentrates on a single application domain — the design of visualization tools  used in visual analytics.</p>
  <p>Like software  engineering and architectural design patterns, VTDPs are not modules and are not  re-usable.  The demands of analysis are  almost infinitely varied due to the enormous variety of data types and analytic  problems.  As a result, any  modularization of VTDPs would necessarily restrict the domain.  Nevertheless, implementations of VTDPs can  take advantage of modular components.   For example, map display software may allow for extra magnifying windows  which can be used to support the pattern comparisons in a large information  VTDP space.</p>
