        <!-- TemplateEndEditable --><!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="body" -->
        <p>A common format for presentation is using PowerPoint slides to  provide a combination of images and words. These media engage two different  &quot;channels&quot;, visual and verbal, through which information is  cognitively processed.  It is critical to  use the channel appropriate to different types of information and also to link  information of the two types properly.<br />
          To convey a set of ideas a presenter constructs a narrative consisting  of three kinds of elements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A verbal sequence expressing ideas and concepts  and reasons for believing them.</li>
          <li>An image sequence expressing both spatial and  non spatial patterns.</li>
          <li>A sequence of links between visual and verbal  materials consisting of deictic gestures, semantic commonalities, and temporal  proximities.  “Deictic gesture” is a  fancy name for the act of pointing as a form of communication. This is the most  common and effective way of linking images and spoken words.</li>
          </ul>
        <img src="Images/PresentationImagesWords.png" alt="Presentation Joint Cognition" />
		<p>An attentive and motivated audience constructs meaning from  a presentation by linking the verbal content to the visual content and to  existing conceptual schemas he or she has formed from prior experience.  <br />
          The key to a successful presentation is that the locus of  attention of audience members tracks the designed narrative sequence.  In other words, audience members should be  looking at parts of the image relevant to the argument and integrating verbal  and visual information to construct new meanings in the way intended.     </p>
        <p>There are many ways in which this system can break down. Audience  members may think ahead, this is especially likely if there are many words on  the slides. Audience members may visually attend to irrelevant details on the  visuals because of failure of the presenter to point out these links and  because the slides contain attractive but irrelevant information.  The audience member may already know the  material or conversely the material may be too difficult for immediate  assimilation because they lack foundational concepts.  Also, the audience member may lack  motivation, failing to see relevance to their personal circumstances.</p>
        <p><strong class="HH2">Cognitive guideline:</em></strong> the most fundamental principle of  multimodal presentation is that appropriate content be assigned to the visual  and verbal channels. Verbal information should  be primarily given in spoken works (not written on the screen). Visual  information consisting of cognitive task relevant charts, diagrams and images  should be shown as imagery.<br />
          <strong class="HH2">Cognitive guideline:</em></strong> ensure adequate links between visual and  verbal information in the form of deictic gestures, semantic commonalities and  temporal proximities.<br />
          <strong class="HH2">Cognitive guideline:</em></strong> motivate the material to show why the  audience should be interested. This will involve constructing a model the  audience’s motivations and knowledge.<br />
          <strong class="HH2">Cognitive guideline:</em></strong> do not reproduce complex arguments in  words on the screen. Doing this can greatly contribute to the speaker losing  control of the cognitive thread of audience members, because people will read  ahead at their own pace, missing things that the speaker is saying, and which  are not on the slides. </p>
        <p class="HH1">Information Suitable for Images </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Imagery information includes charts, diagrams and maps of various type as well as photographic images. Broadly speaking complex patterns can be expressed more efficiently using diagrams. For example, node link diagrams are used to show many structures ranging from company organization charts to the structure of computer software. For more detail consult a reference such as [1] or [2].  Some images, especially photographs can provide powerful motivational material.</p>

    <span class="HH1">Information Suitable for Words </span></p>

  <p class="bodytext">Because of its rich grammatical structure, language is much better at conveying complex arguments, than diagrams. Terms such as: if, then, else, while, perhaps and because, have no counterparts in visualization although of course visual symbols can be constructed to stand for these concepts, but this simply becomes a poor substitute for written language.  The exception is mathematics, where visual symbols are given exact precisely defined meanings. Words can also be used to tell stories which can be effective motivators.</p>
