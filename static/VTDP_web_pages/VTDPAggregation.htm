  <p>In many big data applications it is not possible to show all  entities at once, so they must be aggregated before visualization is possible.  The basic interaction is clicking on an object of interest whereupon it opens  revealing the visual representations of the objects that it stands for. A  reverse operation closes the object. For aggregated objects to be meaningfully  used they must visually portray either sufficient information for decision  making (aggregated average data may be all that needed in some cases).  Aggregated objects must display what Pirolli  and Card call <em>information scent</em>,  graphical cues to what they contain. One solution is to cause that key  information to propagate up using some consolidation method.  This provides visual scent for drill down  operations.   A screen budget combined  with the number of data objects can be used to calculate the degree of  aggregation necessary.</p>
  <p class="bodytext">Example 1:  a  highly modualarized software system consisting of one million lines of code. At the top level there are 10 large modules, each of these contains 20-50 sub modules, and each of these containes 20-50 software objects. Each object conains 30-200 Lines of code. The task is to understand the relationship between components withing and between modules. For examaple which modules are directly connected and how. </p>
  <p class="bodytext">Example 1: A large set of news stories is subject to heirarchical semantic aggregation. The task is to find the major news stories we are not looking for. Obtain a conceptual summary of a corpus of documents. </p>
  <p class="bodytext">Example 2: A nested social network. Some social networks are nested in the sense that individually form highly interconnected local communities, with only weak couplings between communities. These can be easily nested based on community. </p>
  <p class="bodytext">Example 3: File browser. In this variant a single user or group has manually organized their work into folders and sub-folders. </p>

  <p><span class="HH1">Data budget and Screen budget</span>  </p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Implementation Guideline:</span> The number of on screen objects is likely to be somewhere  between ten and a few hundred. Each object can similarly an aggregation of  between ten and  few hundred objects.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="HH2">Data Guideline:</span> Drill down-close out  works best with balanced hierarchies.   For example a ten way tree requires seven clicks to get to leaf nodes  with 10 million items in the data base, but only if the tree is balanced. A 40  way tree only requires 5 clicks.  </p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Data Guideline: </span>It is essential that there be some semantic basis for categorization. There is little point in arbitrary dividing a large homegeneous set of entitities into sub groups. </p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Visual Query Support:</span> If the  visual scent cue being searched for is pre-attentive then the time to click may be  close to constant but if it is not then slow serial search will occur. Often the visual scent is in the form of text labels and search is necessarily serial. Any opportunity to add visual scent can narrow the search and greatly increase cognitive efficiency.  </p>
  <span class="HH2">Cognitive Guideline: </span>Aggregration and resulting information scent should relate to cognitive tasks. 
  <p><span class="HH1">Aggregation methods</span>  </p>
  <p>It is essential that aggregate objects contain and display  useful information.  In general it is  best if the aggregations takes advantage of some inherent structure of the  data.<br />
    Consolidation principle 1: Statistical summary:  Aggregate objects can display basic  statistical properties of the component: sum, median, average.<br />
    Consolidation principle 2: Exeptions: In some monitoring  applications the key information relates to the detection of faults. This  information can be propagated upward. The user notices exceptions during the  visual search and drills down.  <br />
    Consolidation principle 3: Temporal Change: In some  monitoring applications, any change is of interest.  Change information can be propagated  upward.  A change threshold may be  involved.  </p>
  <p class="HH1">IMPLEMENTATIONS</p>
  <p class="HH1">Manual Open Close Operations </p>
  <p>The most common and simple version of this VTDP is the heirarchical tree browers. Clicking on a particular node expands the tree to the next level. It is possible to interactively explore even quite large trees with careful attention to layout. </p>
