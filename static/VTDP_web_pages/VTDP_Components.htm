        <!-- TemplateEndEditable --><!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="body" -->
        <p>A VTDP begins with a statement of the problem it is designed  to solve, together with one or more examples. In most cases it will contain a  pseudo-code description of the combined cognitive process and this will  typically incorporate many the following components.         
        <p><em class="HH2">Perceptual  and Cognitive Operations</em>
        <p>These include converting some part of a problem  into a visual query, mentally adding both imagery and attributes to a perceived symbol or other  feature. Cognitive operations include decisions such as terminating a visual  search when an item is found.  A key  bottleneck in cognitive processing is the capacity of visual working memory, so  situations where visual working memory limits can lead to cognitive inefficiently  are elucidated, and solutions described.        </p>
        <em class="HH2">Visual  Queries </em>
        <p>An aspect of a problem is cognitively transformed so that progress  can be made using a visual pattern search. For example, finding a relationship  in a social network diagram will involve visually tracing a line linking two  nodes.  Visual queries provide a method  for reasoning about key problems of data representation.</p>
        <em class="HH2">Visual  Pattern Processing </em>
        <p>A visual pattern is the target of a visual query. The  goal of efficient graphic design is to ensure that data is mapped into  graphical form in such a way that all probable visual queries can be  efficiently executed.  Most complex  design problems involve tradeoffs; therefore, the pattern mappings for more frequent or more  important visual queries should be more salient.</p>
        <em class="HH2">Working  Memory Load  </em>
        <p>Working memory capacity  is assumed to be at most 4 simple patterns or shapes if the patterns are  previously unknown. If patterns are well known, a skilled analyst can remember many more as well as more complex patterns.</p>
        <em class="HH2">Epistemic  Actions</em>
        <p>These are actions designed to seek information. They include   mouse movements to select data  objects, causing them to reveal more about their attributes, and panning and zooming actions to navigate through a data space. This is a broadening of Kirsh and Magio's [1] initial concept.  It goes beyond manipulations of the environment to include actions that do not actually change the environment but are nevertheless executed to gain knowledge. These include eye  or head movements to pick up detailed information from different parts of a display [2]. </p>
        <em class="HH2">Externalizing</em>
        <p>These are instances where someone saves some knowledge gained, by putting it  out into the world, for example, by adding annotations to a visualization, or  checking boxes to indicate that certain information is deemed important or  irrelevant.</p>
        <em class="HH2">Interaction  Computation</em>
        <p>This includes all parts of a visual thinking algorithm that  are executed in a computer. Of particular relevance to VTDPs are computations  that rapidly change how information is displayed. This can be as  simple as zooming or changing the range of the data that is displayed because  of user interaction.</p>
        <em class="HH2">Display  Budget</em>
        <p>The display budget is the  amount of visual information that can be usefully displayed at a given  time.  For example, there is no point in  displaying a graph with 5000 nodes if very few of them can be visually  resolved.</p>
        <em class="HH2">The VTDP  Virtual Machine</em>
        <p>When thinking about interactive systems, it is useful to  consider the simple virtual machine, illustrated in Figure 1.  This contains a simple visualization pipeline  as well as the key components of perceptual and cognitive processing.  Very often, a gain in cognitive efficiency  can be achieved by shifting part of the workload from visual working memory by  means of simple computations and interactive methods. The basic elements of the visual thinking virtual machine are shown below. </p>
