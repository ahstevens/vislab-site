  <p>Visual queries are components of all visual thinking  algorithms.  They are cognitive constructs. In a visual query, problem  components are identified that have potential solutions based on avisual pattern  search. To initiate a visual query, a pattern is cognitively specified, that  if found in the display will contribute to the solution of a problem.</p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Example 1: </span>In the task for finding how information may have been transfered between individuals using a social network diagram. The first visual queries will be to locate the nodes representing individuals. The final visual query will be to discover if there is a path between those nodes.  </p>

  <p>  <span class="HH2">Example 2: </span>With a weather map visualization base on a model of the wind patterns, visual basic queries will be constructed to discover the temperature, pressure, wind speed, etc at particular locations. More complex visual queries may be formulated to identify  features such as weather fronts and low pressure areas. Still more complex queries will relate these features to the behavior of the jet stream. </p>
  <p>A cognititively efficient design is one in which all the common and important visual queries can be efficiently executed and this should guide the mapping of the data to its graphical representation.</p>

  <p>The problem of what makes a pattern easy to find is not simple. The bulk of the book<em> Information Visualization: Perception for Design</em> is devoted to this topic [1]. Some of the basic issues are summarized below. </p>
  <p>The efficiency of visual search is determined by four things.</p>
  <p><span class="HH2">A-priori salience: </span>Some patterns are inherently salient and almost impossible to ignore. These include blinking lights and a single brighly colored symbol where all other symbols are grey.    </p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Task driven salience: </span>When we search for a pattern, for example red lines denoting highways on a road map, our low level perceptual machinery is re-tuned to make this kind of information stand out more strongly. The corrolary  is that patterns we are not looking for will be often missed even though we may be looking right at them. This is a very strong effect and in complex displays task driven salience is a more important determinant of what is seen than a-priori salience. </p>
  <p>Both task driven and a-priori salience are determined mostly by low level features on a single perceptual channel as shown in the diagram below. Complex compound patterns are not salient unless they differ from surrounding objects on a single feature dimension. This diagram can be used to design for salient. Simply, to make something salient it should differ strongly from all other objects on one of these channels. For example if only one object is red and all the others are neutral grey, it will be salient. Alternatively, if one object moves and all the others are static, it will be salient. </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="Images/Channels.jpg" width="555" height="297" /></p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Knowledge: </span>Visual searching is a skill. If we are familiar with a particular kind of visualization our previous experience will guide where we look depending on the particular cognitive task.    </p>
  <p><span class="HH2">Spatial working memory:</span> In some complex visualization with few visual landmarks it can be hard to remember where we have already looked. Spatial working memory holds information about where we have previously looked for only two or three previous fixations. In some cases externalization support (e.g. allowing the user to mark searched areas) can increase search efficiency. </p>
  <span class="HH2">Implementation Guidelines:</span> In generall determining relative salience is a complex design problem involving tradeoffs. Ware (2012) has more than 200 specific guidelines meant to assist the designer in creating preceptually efficient visualizations. However, the guidelines  only a starting point. It is up to the designer to determine which kinds of pattern should most strongly support visual search based on a detailed task analsys. 
  <p>We  offer one specific guideline here: The most strongly salient cues should be reserved for interactive highlighting methods, such as  <em>brushing</em> or <em>degree of relevance hightlighting</em>. This is because  interactive methods are cognitive task driven and if the set of things that is relevant can be selected by an algorithm  making them very salient will be a benefit, not an irritation. What is highlighted should ideally be what we need at the next instant in a successful implennntation.</p>
