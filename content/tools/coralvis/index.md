This 3D textured coral model was generated using Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry software with video from a GoPro camera. Corals and other static underwater 3D features can be captured once during a dive, and then reconstructed in the lab for further exploration and analysis. Additional tools can be used to measure, highlight, and annotate the 3D characteristics of a specimen.
