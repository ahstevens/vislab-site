Semiotics is the discipline concerned with how symbols convey meaning. Semiotics is mostly concerned with arbitrary symbols, but visual symbols are not arbitrary. To be effective, visual symbols, as used in diagrams and other visualizations must have a good match to the processing mechanisms of the human visual system.

The idea of experimental semiotics is to use perceptual theory combined with rigorous experimental methods to understand scientifically what makes a good representation of data. Wareâ€™s book: Information Visualization: Perception for Design (edition II) is a standard reference work that has helped to define this approach.

In addition to the theoretical approach, we also create optimized and experimentally validatated visualizations for clients such as NOAA. If you need a high quality representation of some data for the web or another purpose, please contact us.
