In the classic form of Virtual Reality (VR), users don a helmet and wear data gloves to get a visual impression that they are in another world. The drawback of this is a form of sensory deprivation—they have no sense of touch and are cutoff from the real world. Fish Tank VR is a term coined by Colin Ware to describe an alternative smaller virtual reality environment (Ware et al. 1993). It involves the creation of a small external virtual workspace external from the user, making it possible to have higher quality visuals, solve many of the problems of stereoscopic display, and have a sense of touch because the workspace is compatible with the spatial range of devices touch as the Phantom™ that produce a high fidelity touch haptic experience. Also, because the virtual world is small and self contained, it can exist within the real world.

One of the measurable advantages of Fish Tank VR is an order of magnitude speedup of the rate at which objects can be oriented in space (Ware and Rose, 1999).
