A class of digital recording tags has been developed that can be attached to marine mammals and thereby record the animals movements and vocalizations over a period of 24 hours or more. Examples of such tags are Dtag, CritterCam, Daily Diary and Acousonde. These tags contain accelerometers, magnetometers and pressure sensors.

TrackPlot™ is a software package designed to help analyze kinematic patterns from tag data. This package allows for novel kinematic patterns to be rapidly identified and analyzed. It also allows for the pseudo-track to be georeferenced if a set of surface fix locations exist. And it allows for sound to be played synchronously with movement.

This software is still somewhat experimental. Please contact [Colin Ware](mailto:cware@ccom.unh.edu) for help in using it.
