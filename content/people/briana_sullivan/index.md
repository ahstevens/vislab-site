Briana Sullivan was hired in 2005 as a Research Scientist in the Visualization Lab. She works on the “Chart of the Future” related project with research focused on value added nautical charts.

#### Research Areas
Electronic Charting, e-Navigation, User Interfaces

#### Research Focus
Her focus includes supplementary data to the charts including:
* Local Notice to Mariners
* the Coast Pilot/Sailing Directions
* Chart 1/INT 1 (symbols)
* Rules and Regulations
* the Light List
* and other marine related data

Her aim is to find optimal data structures for the supplemental data as well as innovative ways to display that data within the context of a nautical chart. She has prototypes for her work at [her website](http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~briana) most notably [ChUM - the Chart Update Mashup](http://vislab-ccom.unh.edu/~briana/chum) that brings the Local Notice to Mariners together with a nautical chart in a Google Maps interface.

#### Setting Standards
Actively involved in the S-100 - [The IHO Universal Hydrographic Data Model](https://iho.int/en/s-100-universal-hydrographic-data-model) development, she serves on several of the [International Hydrographic Organization’s (IHO)](https://iho.int/en/) working groups including:
* Nautical Information Provision Working Group ([NIPWG](https://iho.int/en/nipwg))
* Tides, Water-levels and Currents Working Group ([TWCWG](https://iho.int/en/twcwg))

She also serves as liaison to the U.S. and Brazilian members of The Joint WMO-IOC (World Meteorological Organization – Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission) Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) S-412 (Met-Ocean data) working group for portrayal recommendations.

#### Technology Use
Her platform of choice is the web with a focus on:
* PHP
* Javascript
* HTML5
* XML/XSLT
* SVG
* the semantic web
* Google Maps API
* but she also programs in C/C++ and some python, JAVA and openGL.

#### Education
B.S., Computer Science - UMASS, Lowell  
M.S., Computer Science - UNH (under the supervision of Colin Ware in 2004).

Her master’s thesis involved [linking audio and visual information in a virtual underwater kiosk display](http://ccom.unh.edu/publications/linking-audio-and-visual-information-while-navigating-virtual-reality-kiosk-display-0) that resulted in an interactive museum exhibit at the Seacoast Science Center.
