Drew comes from the beautiful city of Vallejo, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. He earned a degree in music composition at UC Davis and worked in the Los Angeles music industry for a couple of years before switching his focus to the sciences. He discovered the practice of data visualization while working as a scientist at an environmental consulting company in Oakland, California, sparking an ongoing interest in understanding how visualizations can help us make sense of our data and better inform our decisions.

Drew joined the Data Visualization Research Lab (VisLab) at CCOM as a graduate research assistant in 2014 while studying computer science at UNH. He was awarded an M.S. in 2017, and defended his doctoral dissertation titled, "An Empirical Evaluation of Visual Cues for 3D Flow Field Perception," to earn his Ph.D. in February 2021. His current research interests involve designing and evaluating perceptually-grounded methods for visualizing and interacting with three-dimensional data, as well as exploring the use of virtual and augmented realities for oceanographic and maritime precision navigation applications.

Outside of the VisLab, Drew enjoys hiking local trails and taking in the beauty of New Hampshire's nature with his partner.
