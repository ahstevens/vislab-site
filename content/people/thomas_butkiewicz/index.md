Thomas Butkiewicz received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Ithaca College in 2005, where he focused on computer graphics and virtual reality research. During his graduate studies at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, he designed and developed new interactive geospatial visualization techniques, receiving a Masters in Computer Science in 2007 and a PhD in Computer Science in 2010. After a year as a research scientist at The Charlotte Visualization Center, he joined the Joint Hydrographic Center as a post-doctoral research fellow in 2011. In 2012 he joined the faculty as a research assistant professor.

Dr. Butkiewicz specializes in creating highly interactive visualizations, which allow users to perform complex visual analysis on geospatial datasets through unique, intuitive exploratory techniques. His research interests also include multi-touch and natural interfaces, virtual reality, stereoscopic displays, and image processing/computer vision.

His current research projects include visual analysis of 4D dynamic ocean simulations, using Microsoft's Kinect devices to enhance multi-touch screens and provide new interaction methods, multi-touch gesture research, and developing new interface approaches for sonar data cleaning.
