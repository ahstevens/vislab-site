Roland Arsenault was an M.Sc. student and part-time research assistant with Human Computer Interaction Lab of the Dept. of Computer Sciences at the University of New Brunswick before coming to UNH.

As a member of the Data Visualization Research Lab for many years, Arsenault combined his expertise in interactive 3D graphics with his experience in working with various mapping-related technologies to help provide a unique perspective on some of the challenges undertaken at the Center. He has worked on the development of the GeoZui4D real-time environment, software to support AUV and fisheries applications, and the GeoCam.

With the Center’s addition of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), Arsenault has become the ASV lab’s chief software engineer — developing a cross-platform, ocean mapping-focused framework for the Center’s ASV fleet.
